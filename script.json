My family and friends think I have the easiest job in the world. Just stand around the shop and serve customers, right? Oh, please. I barely manage to handle well-behaved customers, let alone the problematic ones. I’d change my job in a heartbeat, if it weren’t for the decent pay considering my (meagre) qualifications."},

I help my parents clean the house, decorate the tree and run a few errands. Out of boredom, I take a leisurely stroll along the street and soak in the sights: the packed trams, the other pedestrians minding their own business, the general festivities happening around me."},

I stop beside a brightly lit display window and look around me. Great. I’m surrounded by (mindless) consumerism. I am about to head back, when I catch sight of what’s in the display window: a mock-up of a living room, complete with a Christmas tree and fireplace, with a family of mannequins dressed in winter clothes and holding out presents, as if exchanging them with one another."},
